        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        The computers we've been using are different from the computers you are about to know!
        Have you ever noticed how long it takes for a google search? Sometimes seconds, and mostly milliseconds! But if
        you ever ask for a long list on your computer, how long may it take? Maybe a few minutes, or hours. But
        sometimes we need really long information from a computer, which might take ages! That’s why quantum computers
        were formed. But how are they different from classical computers?
    </div> <br>
    <div id="classyComp" class="padding">
        <h2>Classical computers</h2>
        These are the computers we’ve been using, like - laptops, computers, tablets and smartphones. The language used
        by the classical computers is binary, and binary is made out of bits - 0 and 1. Now you might think, why are
        there only 2 digits in the binary language? Well this is because the computer can only understand 2 states - ON
        or OFF. The ON state is denoted by 1, and OFF state by 0.
    </div> <br>
    <div id="quantumComp" class="padding">
        <h2>Quantum Computers</h2>
        These are the computers that you’ve never seen or had! They were created for gaining large amounts of
        information in a lesser time. Their language, unlike classical computers, is understood by qubits. The qubits
        also have - 0 and 1, but in addition, a qubit can be a combination of 1 and 0 as well!
    </div> <br>
    <div id="weird" class="padding">
        <h2> Weirdness of qubits!</h2>
        Qubits have really weird properties that makes the reason for using them to solve major problems. Let's get to
        know them!

        <li>Qubits can be at 2 places at a time.</li>
        <li>They can pass through walls. </li>
        <li>If one qubit does a backflip, the other will also do a backflip.</li>

        These might not make sense to you right now, but soon you will get to know how it works!

    </div> <br>
    <div id="superPos" class="padding">
        <h2>Superposition</h2>
        The first two properties are all related to superposition. Remember, how we talked about qubits being a
        combination of 1 and 0? Well this is also a superposition. When an object can be in 2 states before it is known,
        it is a superposition. Let’s understand
        an example: Imagine there is a box, and there is a ball in it. If you are told that the ball can be either red
        or green, and then asked what its colour could be, then what will be your answer?
        Well, you can’t tell the colour until you peek inside the box, but for you, before you peek, the colour of the
        ball is a superposition, because there is 50% chance for it to be red and 50% chance for it to be green! So we
        can say it’s red and green at the same time!
        This is an example of superposition. <br>
        Superposition can also be understood as the neutral state of a qubit, where it can be a combination of various
        possible situations before you know it. <br>
        Superposition is a property of qubits that is really helpful in computer. Let's understand this with a simple
        example: if you have ever played ludo or uno on the computer, you know that the computer chooses it's next step
        randomly, though this randomness it set up to a limit. But in a way, you can say it's chosen by a superposition,
        becuase there can be various possibilities of which step has to be taken.
        This is how superposition gives a boost to the games you play!
    </div> <br>
    <div id="entangle" class="padding">
        <h2>Entanglement</h2>
        This one is about the last property we discussed, "Entanglement". When 2 qubits do similiar acts, they are said
        to be entangled together. For example: when you send a message to your friend, one qubit sends the message
        while the other receives it, this happens because the 2 qubits are entangled.
    </div> <br>
    <div id="gates" class="padding">
        <h2>Quantum Gates and Circuits</h2>
        Now that you know the properties of qubits, let's try to understand how we can change their properties! <br>
        When you put unbaked cake inside the oven, it gets baked once it comes out. similarly, if a qubit passes through
        a gate, it changes to different qubit. The qubit we have before it's put inside the gate, is the input, when it
        comes out and changes, it's the output. <br> This arrangement of gates on a qubit are called Quantum Circuits.
    </div> <br>
    <div id="types" class="padding">
        <h2>Types of Quantum Gates</h2>
        To receive different types of outputs, we have different types of gates - <br>
        <li><b>X gate: </b>This is the gate that changes a qubit to it's oppsosite. for example, if "1" is our input,
            then the output would be "0". If "0" is input, the output would be "1". What if the input is a
            superposition?
            well, the output should either 0 or 1.</li>
        <li><b>H gate:</b> This gate changes the qubit to a superposition. if the input is "0" or "1", the output would
            always be a superposition.</li>
        <li><b>CX gate:</b> This gate is a little different from the last 2. This gate is used to entangle 2 qubits.
        </li>
    </div> <br>
    <div id="python" class="padding">
        <h2>Quantum Gates using Python</h2>
        Till now we've only learned what gates can do, but now we will learn how we can use gates in python! <br> But
        first let's try to understand how to type random statements in python. open python and type this - <br>
        <pre>print("Hello Python World")</pre> Run this code. what do you see? the content written in paranthesis is
        shown to you. here, in this code we told the computer to "print" a certain information (which is written in
        brackets), and to represent that it's text, we also put double quotes (""). <br> To know where to code python
        online, <a href="Guide.html">Click here</a>
        <h3>Defining and using variables</h3>
        We use variables to give a shorter "id" for a long value we might need to use again and again. To define
        variables in python, type this code and use it like this - <br>
        <pre>pets = 2  <br>print(pets)</pre> Run this code. What is the result? its 2. When we say "pets = 2", we mean
        to say that "pets" is a variable and it's value is "2". When we "print" the variable "pets", the value given
        would
        be displayed. <br> <b>Remember:</b> As "pets" here is not a text, we didn't put double quotes ("") to represent
        it. <h3>Using variables with text</h3> Now let us understand how to use variables with normal text in one same
        code. type the following - <br>
        <pre>name = James <br>print("My name is " + name)</pre> Run this code. You'll notice that the part written in
        quotes would be considered as text and printed as it is. While the part without quotes would be considered as a
        variable and it's value would be displayed instead. <h3>Performing calculations in python</h3> We can even
        perform calculations in python! type the code given below - <br>
        <pre>x = 10 <br>y = 15 <br>x + y</pre> Run the code. You will be displayed with the sum of 10 and 15 i.e 25. Now
        can you find products, quotients and differences in the same way? <br> <b>Hint:</b> Try using "*" for
        multiplication and "/" for division.
        <br> <b>Note:</b> Here we didn't have to print text, but numbers, so we didn't need to use print().
        <h3>Forming circuits in python</h3> Its finally happening! we are going to learn how to form quantum circuits in
        python! But first you need to type this code to import the library and run it so that your circuit can be formed
        - <br>
        <pre>from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer<br>from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram</pre>
        <h4>X and Y gate circuit</h4> to make a circuit of the X gate, type this code - <br>
        <pre>qc = QuantumCircuit(1) <br>qc.x(0)<br>qc.draw()</pre> Run this. What do you see? <br> <img
            src="result1.jpg"> <br> This is the circuit we've formed. so, what's going on here?
        well, when we said "qc = QuantumCircuit(1)", we defined a vairiable "qc" which meant Quantum Circuit. in
        paranthesis (), we give the value for the number of circuit we want. When we said "qc.x(0)", we put an "X"
        gate on "qc" by saying "qc.x". in paranthesis, we said the counting of circuit on which we want to put it on i.e
        0. Now you are probably thinking, why did we give "0" in the counting but not 1? well this is because a computer
        starts counting from 0, so when you count 3 apples, the computer counts is as 2 apples! in the end, "qc.draw()"
        means we are asking the computer to draw the circuit. Now can you draw an "H" gate in the same way? try putting
        "qc.h" instead and give the number in paranthesis. <br> <b>Note:</b> In a python, the default initial
        qubit is always 0. <h4>Adding multiple gates</h4> Now we will learn how to put more than one gate in the same or
        different circuit. Type the code given below - <br>
        <pre>qc = QuantumCircuit(1)<br>qc.x(0) <br>qc.h(0) <br>qc.draw()</pre> Run the code. What is the result? <br>
        <img src="result2.jpg"> <br> Here, we derived 2 gates on the same circuit, "H" and "X". now, can you try making
        the two gates on 2 different circuits? <br> <b>Hint:</b> try using "qc = QuantumCircuit(2)" instead and apply
        the gates on different countings.
        <h4>CX gate circuit</h4> This one might be a bit tricky for you to understand, but its still easy, that is to
        make a
        CX gate. Here, of you notice, we'll need to mention which qubits are supposed to be entangled. Type the code
        given
        below - <br>
        <pre>qc = QuantumCircuit(2)<br>qc.cx(0,1) <br>qc.draw()</pre> Run this, what is the output? <br> <img
            src="result3.png"> <br> We nottice that the first and second qubits are represented as entangled. But how
        dies this work? well, notice that we gave 2 values in "qc.cx()", those are the qubit countings that tell which
        qubit has to be entangled. Did you also see the "X" gate in the second qubit and that is connected to the first
        qubit? What is it for? well this connnection between one qubit's gate to the other is shown to represent
        entanglement. What if we swap the values given for "qc.cx()"? well when we write "(1, 0)"" in the paranthesis,
        we mean that qubit "1"(second qubit) is entangled with qubit "0" (first qubit) and vice versa.
